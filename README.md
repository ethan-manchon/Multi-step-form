## 📖 Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the form sequence
- Navigate back to previous steps to update their selections
- View a summary of their selections at the final step and confirm their order
- Experience a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements
- Receive form validation messages when:
  - A required field is empty
  - An email address is not correctly formatted
  - A step is submitted without a selection

## 🧠 My process

### Built with

- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) – Vue.js framework
- [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com/) – UI component library for Nuxt
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) – State management library for Vue
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – Utility-first CSS framework

---

## 💡 What I learned

This was my first project using **Nuxt**, **Nuxt UI**, and **Pinia**. I explored these technologies as part of an internship and learned how to build a multi-step form with state management, dynamic navigation, and form validation.

---

## 🔄 Continued development

I will continue working with **Nuxt** throughout my internship. In future projects, I plan to focus on:
- Advanced store patterns with Pinia
- Creating reusable and dynamic components with Nuxt UI
- Improving client-side and server-side validation and routing in Nuxt
