# Multi-Step Form - Frontend Mentor Challenge

This project is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor Multi-Step Form Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io). It is built using **Nuxt 3**, **Nuxt UI**, and **Pinia** for state management. This is my first project using these technologies.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create a responsive multi-step form with validation and dynamic state management. The form allows users to navigate between steps, save their progress, and submit the data.

## Setup

```bash
# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install

# yarn
yarn install

# bun
bun install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
# npm
npm run dev

# pnpm
pnpm dev

# yarn
